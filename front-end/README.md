# Front-end Development

In this module I learn about `react`, `redux`, `agile`, `react testing library` and `hooks`.

With that I became able to create beautiful and functional web applications with the React Framework.

With that in mind, this folder contains all the learning activities I developed throughout the `Front-end Development` module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course.
