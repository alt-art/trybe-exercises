# Git and Github

# BLOCK 2

This block belongs to the `fundamentals` module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course. In this block I learned about how to use `git` and `Github` make `brachs` and `pull requests`.

With that in mind, here you will find the exercises I developed to anchor the knowledge I gained throughout this block.
